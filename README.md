This project is part of the course I am taking on Udemy and involves recreating the classic Simon game. The objective of the game is to test and improve the player's memory by challenging them to repeat color sequences that increase in complexity with each round.

Features:
Interactive Interface: The game features an intuitive and visually appealing design, enhancing the user experience.

Difficulty Levels: The color sequences become more difficult as the player progresses, providing a constant challenge.

Immediate Feedback: Sounds and animations indicate whether the player has correctly repeated the sequence or not.

Responsiveness: The game is fully responsive, working well on different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Page structure.
CSS: Styling and animations.
JavaScript: Game logic and DOM manipulation.

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply and consolidate my knowledge in web development, as well as challenge myself to think logically and creatively. I am very satisfied with the final result and eager to continue learning and improving my skills.
